      <header class="major"><h2>Project Overview</h2></header>
      <p>This section showcases a series of Linux system administration projects carried out for a fictional enterprise, <strong>Dunder-Mifflin</strong>. The goal was to build a robust, automated, and secure server infrastructure across multiple operating systems and network segments.</p>

      <header class="major"><h2>Network Topology</h2></header>
      <p>The network design includes a Rocky Linux router, DNS and web servers across both Rocky and Debian distributions, a file server using AlmaLinux, and a FreeBSD host. Machines are divided between a LAN (10.21.32.0/24) and a DMZ (100.64.N.0/24) segment.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>User Management Automation:</strong> This was the first step of the project. A script was developed to automate the creation and management of user accounts across Linux (Machines A–F) and FreeBSD (Machine X). It handles:
          <ul>
            <li>Username generation based on employee names (first initial + last name)</li>
            <li>Uniform password setup across all machines</li>
            <li>Creation of home directories with proper permissions and ownership</li>
            <li>Assignment to secondary groups like managers, sales, and accounting</li>
            <li>Setup of shared group directories with group ID inheritance</li>
            <li>Integration of existing user data on Machine E</li>
            <li>Granting sudo access to administrators</li>
            <li>System-wide umask configuration for secure default permissions</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Access Control & Privilege Management:</strong> The second step of the project involved securing administrative access and enabling task-specific permissions based on job roles. Key configurations included:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Password-less SSH Login:</strong> Set up for Pam Beesly, Kelly Kapoor, and Andy Bernard from Machine E to Machine C to streamline access.</li>
            <li><strong>Custom Sudo Access:</strong> Dwight Schrute was granted full sudo command access on all machines without being added to the sudo/wheel groups, ensuring least-privilege compliance.</li>
            <li><strong>Controlled Shutdown Access:</strong> Michael Scott can execute timed shutdowns (1–999 minutes) on DMZ machines (B, C, D, F) with appropriate warnings and cancellation abilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Restricted chown Access:</strong> Jim Halpert can change file ownership on Machine E to any user except root, allowing operational flexibility without elevating risk.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Multi-Site Apache Web Server Configuration:</strong> The third step involved hosting multiple websites from Machine C using Apache. The key components included:
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Multi-site Hosting:</strong> Apache served 3 virtual hosts — Dunder Mifflin, Michael Scott Paper Company, and Schrute Farms — with and without “www.” support.</li>
            <li><strong>Site Permissions:</strong> Pam Beesly, Kelly Kapoor, and Andy Bernard could update the Dunder Mifflin site, while Dwight managed Schrute Farms — without elevated privileges.</li>
            <li><strong>DocumentRoot Setup:</strong> Each site was hosted under <code>/var/www/html/&lt;site-name&gt;</code> according to ISP specifications.</li>
            <li><strong>Backup Server:</strong> Machine D acted as a mirror of Machine C, syncing every 5 minutes via rsync for high availability.</li>
            <li><strong>Disk Usage CGI:</strong> A secure CGI script tracked file count and disk usage for each website, restricted by Apache Auth and accessible only via internal domain.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Networking & Host Configuration:</strong> Static IP assignments, functional hostnames, and subnet-based segmentation.</li>
        <li><strong>DNS Server Setup:</strong> BIND-based DNS for forward/reverse lookups, recursive resolution, and zone syncing.</li>
        <li><strong>User & File Management:</strong> NFS file sharing and centralized user provisioning using Ansible roles.</li>
        <li><strong>Security & Access Control:</strong> PAM policies for password rules and time-based access restrictions.</li>
        <li><strong>Backup & Redundancy:</strong> RAID configurations, NFS automation, and rsync for reliable data protection.</li>
        <li><strong>System Automation:</strong> Ansible for server hardening, consistency enforcement, and system updates.</li>
        <li><strong>Time Sync:</strong> NTP/Chrony setup with stratum-based hierarchy across Linux and FreeBSD machines.</li>
      </ul>

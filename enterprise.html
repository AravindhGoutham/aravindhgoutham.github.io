        <p>In the Enterprise Networks course, I gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing scalable and secure network infrastructures. I completed a range of projects involving Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), VLAN configuration, and dynamic routing using RIP, EIGRP, and OSPF for both IPv4 and IPv6. The course also covered advanced topics such as Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF), Network Address Translation (NAT), and wireless LAN deployment. I implemented IPsec site-to-site VPNs to secure inter-site communications and worked with MPLS and RSVP-TE tunnels for efficient traffic engineering. These practical assignments deepened my understanding of enterprise-level networking and prepared me to handle complex real-world network environments.</p>

      <p>For the final practical in <strong>CSCI 5160: Introduction to Enterprise Networks</strong> at CU Boulder, I tackled a complex, hands-on project that emulated a real-world service provider environment using physical Cisco routers. This challenging lab required deep understanding and practical application of advanced networking concepts, including <strong>MPLS Traffic Engineering</strong>, <strong>IPv6 transition mechanisms</strong>, and <strong>GRE/IPsec site-to-site tunnels</strong>.</p>

      <p>The network core was built with <strong>RSVP-based MPLS TE tunnels</strong> using Explicit Route Objects (EROs), bandwidth constraints, and LDP fallback for failover. I deployed <strong>GRE over IPsec tunnels</strong> between customer edge sites running OSPF, configured <strong>IPv6 GRE tunnels secured with IPsec</strong>, and enabled <strong>OSPFv3 for dynamic IPv6 routing</strong>. Dual-stack routing was implemented across the topology, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.</p>

      <p>Advanced services included <strong>IPv6 Prefix Delegation</strong> with /48 assignments to CE sites, where I configured <strong>DHCPv6</strong> (stateful) and <strong>SLAAC</strong> (stateless) for host address assignment. I also integrated <strong>NAT-PT</strong> to bridge communication between IPv4-only and IPv6-only networks, and routed all external traffic through PE_99 using NAT and a custom public address pool. The project tested both theoretical knowledge and practical configuration skills, reinforcing real-world ISP and enterprise networking design.</p>

      <h4>Key Technologies:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>MPLS, RSVP-TE, LDP</li>
        <li>GRE, IPsec, OSPF, OSPFv3</li>
        <li>NAT-PT, IPv6 Prefix Delegation</li>
        <li>Stateful & Stateless DHCPv6, SLAAC</li>
        <li>Dual-stack Routing, ECMP, Static Routing</li>

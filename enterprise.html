        <p>In the Enterprise Networks course, I gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing scalable and secure network infrastructures. I completed a range of projects involving Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), VLAN configuration, and dynamic routing using RIP, EIGRP, and OSPF for both IPv4 and IPv6. The course also covered advanced topics such as Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF), Network Address Translation (NAT), and wireless LAN deployment. I implemented IPsec site-to-site VPNs to secure inter-site communications and worked with MPLS and RSVP-TE tunnels for efficient traffic engineering. These practical assignments deepened my understanding of enterprise-level networking and prepared me to handle complex real-world network environments.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>STP (Spanning Tree Protocol):</strong> Configured STP to prevent switching loops in the network, ensuring a loop-free and redundant Layer 2 topology.</li>
        <li><strong>VLANs (Virtual LANs):</strong> Created and managed VLANs to logically segment the network into different broadcast domains, enhancing security, performance, and manageability.</li>
        <li><strong>EtherChannel:</strong> Implemented EtherChannel by bundling multiple physical links into a single logical connection to increase bandwidth and provide redundancy between switches or routers.</li>
        <li><strong>OSPF (Open Shortest Path First): </strong>Deployed OSPF as a link-state routing protocol to dynamically calculate the shortest path for data routing within an autonomous system using Dijkstra's algorithm.</li>
        <li><strong>MPLS-TE Tunnels:</strong> Configured MPLS Traffic Engineering tunnels using RSVP-TE to optimize path selection, improve bandwidth utilization, and provide predictable routing across service provider networks.</li>
        <li><strong>NAT:</strong> Configured static and dynamic NAT to allow internal devices to securely access external networks.</li>
        <li><strong>VRF:</strong> Isolated routing instances using Virtual Routing and Forwarding to simulate multi-tenant architecture.</li>
        <li><strong>IPv6 Tunnels:</strong> Set up IPv6-over-IPv4 tunnels to enable next-gen IP communication over legacy infrastructure.</li>
        <li><strong>IPsec Site-to-Site Tunnels:</strong> Established secure VPN tunnels between remote offices using IPsec protocols.</li>
        <li><strong>Stateful NAT:</strong> Enabled stateful NAT with session tracking for consistent IP translations and return path integrity.</li>
      </ul>
